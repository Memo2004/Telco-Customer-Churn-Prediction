# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for predicting customer churn in a telecommunications company. The project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze customer data and identify factors that contribute to churn.

## Project Overview

Customer churn, the loss of customers, is a critical issue for telecommunication companies. This project aims to:

* **Analyze Customer Data:** Explore and understand the patterns and relationships within the provided telco customer dataset.
* **Develop Predictive Models:** Build machine learning models to predict customer churn.
* **Identify Key Churn Factors:** Determine the most influential features contributing to customer churn.
* **Provide Actionable Insights:** Offer insights that can help the company take proactive measures to retain customers.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is typically a `.csv` file containing customer information, including:

* Demographic information (gender, age, etc.)
* Service usage (phone, internet, etc.)
* Account information (contract type, payment method, etc.)
* Churn status (yes/no).

(Please ensure to specify the data source, and any specifics regarding the data cleaning or preprocessing if significant)
